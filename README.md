# MusicEngine

__MusicEngine__ is a dynamic music library for SuperCollider that facilitates the generation of note ranges for use in other projects. Given its ability to generate ranges from two to twelve degrees, MusicEngine is flexible enough to generate chord or scale note ranges.

__MusicEngine__ uses a system of verbose range symbols, where all intervals, or degrees, are expressed after a root note (e.g., _F#M3P5m7_). This data is then used to generate note information. Additionally, an alias system maps conventional symbols to their verbose representation for convenience (e.g., _FMaj7 -> FM3P5M7_). When generating a range, the user may use either format.

Note ranges are arrays of `MENote` objects that encapsulate all data pertaining to each note (e.g., MIDI number, frequency, note name, degree, octave, etc.). Note ranges gather all notes belonging to any chord or scale across the entire MIDI range (0-127), spanning a total of 11 octaves.

__MusicEngine__ is currently in its `version 0.0.0`.

## Basic Usage

A note range may be generated by creating an instance of `MENoteRange`, passing a chord symbol as argument. Chord symbol must be of type `String`:

```supercollider
~range = MENoteRanges.new("Gm3P5M6M7");
```

`MENoteRange` generates an array of `MENote` objects, that encapsulate all data for any given note.

We can retrieve data from each note by calling on its properties:

```supercollider
~range.notes[19].degree     // m3
~range.notes[19].name       // Bb4
~range.notes[19].sol        // Sib4 (solfege naming convention)
~range.notes[19].accidental // b
~range.notes[19].midi       // 70
~range.notes[19].freq       // 466.16376151809
~range.notes[19].octave     // 4
```

We can return the name without the octave, when using the methods `name` and `sol`, by setting `withOctave` to false:

```supercollider
~range.notes[19].name(withOctave: false) // Bb
```

The `MENotes` object has additional properties that can be set by the user:

```supercollider
~range.notes[19].duration     = 1;
~range.notes[19].articulation = 0.99; // \legato
~range.notes[19].dynamic      = 0.5;
```

If we want to handle data directly, and not through a `MENotes` object, we can call on several `MENoteRange` instance methods to get arrays for most of the properties found in `MENotes`:

```supercollider
~range.degrees; // [P5, M6, M7, Rt, ...]
~range.names;   // [D1, E1, F#1, G1, ...]
~range.sol;     // [Re1, Mi1, Fa#1, Sol1, ...]
~range.midi;    // [26, 28, 30, 31, ...]
~range.freq;    // [36.708095989676, 41.203444614109, 46.249302838954, ...]
```

Ranges may be filtered by specifying the first and last octaves, as well as from which degree the sequence should start:

```supercollider
~range.midi(fromOctave: 4, toOctave: 5, fromDegree: "Rt"); // [67, 70, 74, 76, 78, 79, 82]
```
This will start the sequence in _G4_, and end in the last note found in octave 5.

When setting this parameter, we should be mindful to only pick degrees present in the chord. If we choose a _M2_, as an example:

```supercollider
~range.midi(fromOctave: 4, toOctave: 5, fromDegree: "M2");
```

We will get the error:

```terminal
ERROR: Range does not include interval M2. Pick from Rt, m3, P5, M6, M7.

CALL STACK:
	Exception:reportError
    (...)
```
## Range Symbols

A range symbol may be built using a verbose syntax, where all intervals are discriminated after a root, or by appending a conventional symbol to a root.
